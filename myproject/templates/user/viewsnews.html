        Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and downloaded proprietary software for the International Space Station. The
        software supported the International Space Station's physical environment and was responsible for critical
        control of humidity and temperature for living in space. NASA officials valued the documents stolen by James at
        around $1.7 million. The incident forced NASA to shut down its computer systems for three weeks and cost them
        about $41,000 to fix

    <b class="mt-3 text-center text-warning">CHENNAI: The Madras high court has remained the activity of the oversight
        instrument acquired through the new Information Technology Act Rules by the Union government, saying it might
        deny the media of its freedom. “…the Fourth Pillar, so to say, of democracy may not at all be there,” the
        principal seat of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu said on Thursday. The court
        mentioned the observable facts while passing the between time request remaining the activity of Rule 9 (1) and
        (3) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. Pointing
        out that a comparable request has likewise been passed by the Bombay high court, the seat said, “Indeed, there
        may have been no need to pass an independent order. However, it is submitted on behalf of the petitioners that
        notwithstanding the order passed by the Bombay HC, which ought to have a pan-India effect, notices have been
        issued to the petitioners subsequently requiring them to adhere to the rules.” The issue relates to two separate
        supplications moved by entertainer T M Krishna and Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) testing the
        guidelines. It should be recorded with all reasonableness that the extra specialist general addressing the Union
        acknowledges that the request for the Bombay high court has a container India impact, the court added. The issue
        relates to two separate supplications moved by entertainer T M Krishna and Digital News Publishers Association
        (DNPA) testing the guidelines. Krishna fought that the standard is ultra vires the parent act — the Information
        Technology Act — other than forcing subjective, ambiguous and absurd limitations on computerized news media and
        web-based media go-betweens. “The code of ethics contained in Part II of the rules is likely to create a
        chilling effect on speech, where creators of content will self-censor themselves and produce art that is
        acceptable to the state, rather than art which, otherwise legitimate, pushes the boundaries of societal,
        religious, political and cultural norms,” Krishna said. He added that the guidelines annoy his right as a
        craftsman and a social/political reporter by forcing a chilling impact on free discourse and by impinging to his
        right side to protection.
